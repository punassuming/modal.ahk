rem Set or toggle iTunes muting.
rem Note that this is a different mute control than
rem that provided by your sound card (which can be easily
rem accessed by double-clicking on the speaker icon in the
rem system tray).
rem Use of this script to control the iTunes muting is
rem not recommended (unless you've got a special need in mind).

rem Syntax:
rem Mute [on|off]
rem Examples:
rem Mute		toggles the current muting state
rem Mute on		turns on muting
rem Mute off	turns off muting

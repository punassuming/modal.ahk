rem This script tells iTunes to play the previous track.
rem Note that this will always move to the previous track,
rem regardless of the position within the current track.
rem You can use the script BackTrack.vbs to use the "back track"
rem feature of iTunes, which restarts the current track if you're
rem at least a few seconds into it, or goes to the previous track
rem if you're within the first few seconds of the current track.
